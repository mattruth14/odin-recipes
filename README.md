theodinproject.com - 1st foundations project

## What this project is about:
This first html foundations project on theodinproject.com is a beginner level recipe website aimed at testing basic html and github knowledge. By the end of this short project, I will have completed a website containing multiple html files (pages), containing various elements including links, imgs, text, lists, etc.

## Where I am before attempting:
I have completed the freeCodeCamp.org responsive web design course already and worked on a few of my own projects, alongside making lots of notes - so I am confident going into this assignment.
